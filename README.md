# AutoHotKey Time Log 

[AutoHotKey](autohotkey.com) is a scripting language for Windows, which can be useful in creating simple GUI apps, remapping and creating hotkeys, and much more. Here I'm simply using AHK, effectively as a stopwatch, and user input to output timestamps to a .txt file that can be post-processed for analysis.

For post-processing the data I use Python and [plotly](http://plot.ly) for its simple and interactive graphs outputted as an html file. 

### Future Development
- Create html template and dashboard for more advanced interactive graphs at once
- Serve up local database and check for updates with javascript
